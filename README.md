Use xelatex to produce PDF

I've hard coded the font paths into the text  -- change this to where your fonts are. You'll see I've experimented with different fonts and the LaTeX is pretty robust.

The master version is intended to be printed on A4, and then given to the printer to produce an A5 booklet. To produce directly in A5 format, use the A5 branch but this will need tweaking and may be behind. In future, I'll factor out the LaTeX code that handles it. Next year...
