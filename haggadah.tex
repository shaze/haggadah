\begin{HgEnglish}
We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and our God brought us out from there
with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
Now, if God had not brought our ancestors out from Egypt, then we, our
children, and our children's children might still be enslaved to Pharaoh in
Egypt.  Therefore, even if we were all wise, all understanding, all learned in
the ways of Torah, we would still be obligated to tell the story of the Exodus.
And indeed, everyone who dwells upon the features of the Exodus is
praiseworthy.

%It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi
%Akiva and Rabbi Tarphon were reclining [at a seder] in B'nei Berak. They were
%discussing the exodus from Egypt all that night, until their students came and
%told them: ``Masters! The time has come for reciting the morning Sh'ma!''
Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: I have lived to be a man of threescore years and
ten, yet I did not understand why the story of the Exodus should be told at
night until Ben Zoma explained it to me. He said: It is said, ``That thou mayest
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of
thy life.'' (Deuteronomy 16:3) ``The days of your life'' would have meant the
days only, but ``all the days of your life'' includes the nights also.  The
Sages of Israel explain it further: ``The days of your life'' refers to this
world, while ``All the days of your life'' includes the time of the Messiah.

\end{HgEnglish}

\HgInst{Continue}

\begin{HgEnglish}
The Torah speaks of four kinds of children: The wise child, the wicked
child, the simple child, and the child who does not know how to ask.
\begin{myitemize}
\item The wise child asks: ``What is the meaning of the testimonies, laws and
judgments which God has commanded you?''\\
To that one, you explain all the laws of Passover, down to the very last detail
about the Afikoman

\item  The wicked child asks: ``What does all of this mean to you?'' (Exodus
12:26). By saying ``you,'' and not ``we'' or ``me,'' he excludes himself from the group,
and denies God. 

Answer plainly: ``This is done because of what the
Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.'' ``For me, not for you:
if you had been there in Egypt, you would not have been redeemed.''

\item The simple child asks: ``What is this?'' 

Answer that one: ``By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from
the house of bondage.'' 

\item To the child who does not know how to ask, speak first, it is written: ``And
thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which
the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.'' 
\end{myitemize}
\end{HgEnglish}

%At first our forefathers worshiped idols, but now the Omnipresent has
%brought us near to His service, as it is written: “Joshua said to all
%the people: so says Adonai God of Israel--your fathers have alwayslived beyond the Euphrates River, Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor; they worshipped other gods. I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river and led him through all the land of Canaan. I multiplied his family and gave him Isaac. To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau; to Esau I gave Mount Seir to inherit, however Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.”

\begin{HgEnglish}
My father was a wandering Aramean. He went down to Egypt sojourned
there in small numbers, and became a large, mighty and populous
nation. They said to Pharaoh, we have come to sojourn in the land, for
there is no pasture for your servants' flocks because the hunger is
severe in the land of Canaan; and now, please, let your servants dwell
in the land of Goshen.

The Egyptians treated us badly. They acted cunningly against us. They
set taskmasters over us to make us suffer with burdens, and we built
storage cities for Pharaoh, Pitom and Ramses.'

They afflicte us. As it is said: ``The Egyptians made the children of Israel work with rigor. And they made their lives bitter with hard work, with mortar and with bricks and all manner of service in the field, all their work which they made them work with rigor.''
\end{HgEnglish}

\HgInst{Continue}
\begin{HgEnglish}
And we cried out to Adonai, the God of our fathers, and Adonai heard
our voice and saw our suffering, our labor and our oppression, and
remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Adonai took us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched
arm, and with a great manifestation, and with signs and wonders."

``Adonai took us out of Egypt," not through an angel, not through a
seraph and not through a messenger. The Holy One, blessed be He, did
it in His glory by Himself!

Thus it is said: ``In that night I will pass through the land of Egypt,
and I will smite every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man to
beast, and I will carry out judgments against all the gods of Egypt, I
the Adonai."

``I will pass through the land of Egypt,'' I and not an angel; ``And I
will smite every first-born in the land of Egypt," I and not a
seraph. And I will carry out judgments against all the gods of Egypt,"

  It is said that Rabbi Levi Yitz\d{h}ak of Berditchev discovered that the young
  girls who kneaded the dough for matzah worked from early in the morning until
  late at night. Every 17 minutes, the workers had to scrub their hands, to be
  sure that no particle of yeast remained on their fingers that might leaven the
  next batch of dough; by the end of a shift, their hands were chapped and
  bloody.  The Rabbi pronounced the matzah treyf because it was produced through
  oshek (the oppression of workers), and said: ``They accuse us of making our
  matzah with the blood of Christians, but in truth we make it from the blood of
  our own people.'' 
\end{HgEnglish}

\begin{HgEnglish}
  It is a Torah mitzvah to eat matzah on Seder night.  Jewish law defines an act
  of ``eating'' as swallowing a kezayit within two to four minutes (kiday
  achilat pras). If this is difficult, you may sip some water while eating. At
  the very least, the matzah must be consumed within nine minutes.  The time
  begins not with the first bite, but with the first swallow.  Therefore, you
  can gain some extra time by chewing up some matzah before taking the first
  swallow.  A kezayit is approximately 45-50 cc, which is roughly two thirds of
  a square matzah, or one half of the hand-made round matzah.

and a prize is awarded to the one who finds it.

Traditionally, it's even less straightforward. The seder cannot proceed until
the afikoman has been eaten, and so the child who holds it finds herself with an
excelleng bargaining token. Rather than simply being given a prize, she uses the
matzah to extort a gift of her choosing from the adults.

\begin{HgEnglish}
  The structure of the Passover seder appears to be
  modeled, at least in part, after a Greek symposium. At this point in the
  evening, the Greeks would begin the {\itshape epikomion}---after-dinner
  entertainment featuring drunken revelry, flute music and group sex.
