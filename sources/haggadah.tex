\hchapter{סדר}

We are gathered tonight to retell the story of the exodus from Egypt. ``Seder''
means ``order'', and ``haggadah'' means ``the telling''. This meal is at once an
opportunity to recall our history, a ritual substitute for the Passover
sacrifice that was offered in the Temple days, and a celebration of the freedom
we now enjoy.

  The passover seder as we know it, however, actually originated in late
  antiquity, in Roman Palestine in the first centuries of the Common Era. That
  historical context is very important because both the very structure and
  format of the haggadah text reflects not only those conventions but also the
  inevitable cultural changes that occurred when Jews moved from Roman Palestine
  to other cultures in the Diaspora \HgEllipsis

  Let me give one brief example: The passage that we know as the
  Four Questions originally consisted of three, not four questions, and each
  question directly addressed one of the three symbolic foods eaten at the
  seder---the maror (which are the bitter herbs customarily eaten with
  \d{h}aroset) the matzah, and the Passover sacrifice. As it happens, each of
  these three foods also related to the three courses that were customarily
  eaten at a Greco-Roman banquet. \\

  According to one tradition, we recite this portion in Aramaic rather than
  Hebrew so that the angels (who can't understand Aramaic) don't take us up on
  our offer and crash the party.

  Various reasons are given for breaking the middle matzah: to remind us that
  the task of liberation, like the matzah, is incomplete; or in commemoration of
  the time when we were poor and hungry. Another commentary tells us that the
  Hebrew slaves, making their way to freedom, couldn't know when their next meal
  would come, so they ate only a small amount of matzah and hid the rest for
  later.

\begin{HgEnglish}
  It is written [Deut. xvi. 3]: ``Bread of affliction'' (le\d{h}em oni), and as
  ``oni'' can also stand for ``proclaiming,'' the bread may be called ``bread of
  proclamation,'' i.e., ``bread over which proclamations should be made,'' and
  thus we have also learned [from the Oral Law]. Or ``Oni'' may still be called
  ``poor,'' and for the reason that the benediction pertaining to the eating of
  the unleavened bread should be made over a broken piece after the manner of
  the poor.

This invitation appears to be presented at the wrong time, for Kiddush has

[\ldots] What purpose do these invitations serve?

The Pesach Seder is a celebration of our redemption and we are all guests of
honor. To prevent the guests from feeling beholden to [host,] which would
inhibit their involvement and participation in the evening, we begin the Seder
by allowing the guests to invite others. The Talmud states "a guest is not
permitted to invite other guests". However, a guest of honor has the right to
invite whomever he chooses. The message we are relaying to all the participants
is they are not merely guests beholden to the homeowner. Rather, they are all
guests of honor, celebrating their own redemption. [\ldots] The purpose of the
invitation is for the guests already assembled, not for those who are absent.

It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi
Akiva and Rabbi Tarphon were reclining [at a seder] in B'nei Berak. They were
discussing the exodus from Egypt all that night, until their students came and
told them: ``Masters! The time has come for reciting the morning Sh'ma!''

Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: I have lived to be a man of threescore years and
ten, yet I did not understand why the story of the Exodus should be told at
night until Ben Zoma explained it to me. He said: It is said, ``That thou mayest
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of
thy life.'' (Deuteronomy 16:3) ``The days of your life'' would have meant the
days only, but ``all the days of your life'' includes the nights also.  The
Sages of Israel explain it further: ``The days of your life'' refers to this
world, while ``All the days of your life'' includes the time of the Messiah.

  The Seder is thus a giant yet intimate classroom, with the Haggada serving as
  the subject matter, and the father as the main educator entrusted with the
  role of engaging pupils in a discussion based on a question and answer format
  [\ldots] in the hope of involving everyone present. Listening is passive and
  stagnant; far better to inquire, probe and analyze our oldest Jewish festival.

\chapter*{Magid: The Passover story \\ {\LARGE The four children}}

\vfill

\HgHL{The Torah speaks of four kinds of children: The wise child, the wicked
  child, the simple child, and the child who does not know how to ask.}\\
The wise child asks: ``What is the meaning of the testimonies, laws and
judgments which God has commanded you?''

To that one, you explain all the laws of Passover, down to the very last detail
about the Afikoman. \\[1em]
The wicked child asks: ``What does all of this mean to you?'' (Exodus 12:26)

By saying ``you,'' and not ``we'' or ``me,'' he excludes himself from the group,
and denies God. Answer that child plainly: ``This is done because of what the
Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.'' (Exodus 13:8) ``For me, not for you:
if you had been there in Egypt, you would not have been redeemed.''\\[1em]
The simple child asks: ``What is this?'' 

Answer that one: ``By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from
the house of bondage.'' (Exodus 13:14)\\[1em]
To the child who does not know how to ask, speak first, it is written: ``And
thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which
the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.'' (Exodus 13:8) \LSrc

Wise, wicked, simple, does not know how to ask. This order conforms neither to
the order in which the children are mentioned in the Torah (Wicked, Simple, Does
Not Know How to Ask, Wise), nor to the order of their moral standing, in which
the wicked child should be last.

Rather, they are listed in order of their intellectual capacities: The wise
child; the wicked child, who is also wise but whose insolence leads him to act
wickedly; the simple child, who has at least enough intelligence to ask; and
finally the one who does not know how to ask

\begin{HgEnglish}
  When the wicked child says “What is this service to you?” we assume he is
  excluding himself. But doesn’t the wise child also refer to “the
  testimonies\ldots{}that God our God has commanded to you”?

  The wicked child makes no mention of God; the wise child refers to “God our
  God,” clearly including himself. He uses “you” in the sense of “you who came
  out of Egypt and received God’s commandments,” as opposed to himself who was
  not yet born when the commandment was given.

  While the Four Sons differ from one another in their reaction to the Seder,
  they have one thing in common: they are all present at the Seder.
  \HgEllipsis{} Unfortunately, in our time of confusion and spiritual
  bankruptcy, there is another kind of a Jewish child---a ``fifth son'', who is
  conspicuous by his absence from the Seder; the one who has no interest
  whatsoever in Torah and commandments, laws and customs; who is not even aware
  of the Passover Seder, of the Exodus from Egypt and the subsequent Revelation
  at Sinai. \HgEllipsis

  Finding themselves a small minority, and encountering social and economic
  difficulties, some parents had the mistaken notion, which they transmitted to
  their children, that the way to overcome these difficulties is to become
  quickly assimilated into the new environment by discarding the heritage of
  their forefathers and abandoning the Jewish way of life. Finding that this
  process leads to the discomfort of inner spiritual conflict, some parents
  resolved to spare their children this conflict altogether. \HgEllipsis

  By this attitude, these parents hoped to assure their children's existence and
  survivial in the new environment. But what kind of existence is it, if
  everything spiritual and holy is traded for the material? What kind of
  survival is it, if it means the sacrifice of the soul for the amenities of the
  body?

\hchapter{מגיד}

\vfill

\begin{HgEnglish}
  \small
  There was a famine in Canaan.
  So Jacob,
  his wives and his concubines,
  his sons, their wives,
  their children and their servants went down to Egypt.
  Jacob's people were shepherds, 
  so the Pharaoh gave them land in Goshen for grazing, 
  and they flourished there.

  They had many children. 
  Jacob died, 
  then the Pharaoh, 
  then all of Jacob's children,
  but by that time the Israelites were so numerous
  the new Pharaoh began to fear them.
  So he took away
  their fields and their flocks, 
  and made them slaves.
  He set taskmasters over them,
  and forced them to build the granary-cities of Pitom and Ramses.

  Still they multiplied, 
  and still the Pharaoh was afraid. 
  Finally he decided to destroy them entirely: 
  He decreed that all the male children of the Israelites 
  would be drowned in the Nile.
  
  There was a woman, a Levite,
  who had a son and hid him for three months.
  When she could no longer conceal him,
  she placed him in a basket of bulrushes,
  and floated him on the Nile.
  The Pharaoh's daughter, bathing in the river, found him.
  She said,
  ``This is an Israelite child, 
  but I will raise him as my son.''
  She drew him out of the river, 
  and called him Moses, which means
  ``who is drawn out''.

  Once, when Moses was older, 
  he came across an Egyptian
  beating an Israelite slave. 
  He was so enraged he struck the Egyptian, who fell down dead.
  Fearing punishment, 
  Moses fled to the hills
  and lived there for years with a neighboring tribe.

  One day, walking, he saw smoke. 
  The smoke came from a bush, 
  which burned but did not burn up in the fire. 
  God spoke to Moses from the bush, 
  and commanded him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. 
  ``Lord,'' said Moses,
  ``I am slow of speech. 
  Take someone else.'' 
  God said ``Then let your brother Aaron speak for you.
  You will put the words in his mouth, 
  and I will put them in yours.
  You will lead the Israelites out of Egypt.''

  So Moses and Aaron went to the Pharaoh, 
  and said ``Let my people go.'' 
  And Aaron threw his staff on the ground, where it became a snake.
  The Egyptian magicians also threw their staffs on the ground,
  and turned them into snakes,
  but Aaron's snake ate the others.
  Then the Pharaoh was afraid. 
  But God hardened the Pharaoh's heart,
  and he would not let the Israelites go.

  Then God sent plagues down on the Egyptians: 
  he turned the Nile to blood, 
  made it crawl with frogs and lice and gnats, 
  afflicted the Egyptians with pestilence and boils, 
  with hail and locusts, 
  and he covered Egypt in darkness.
  After each plague Moses and Aaron went to the Pharaoh 
  and said ``Let my people go,'' 
  and each time God hardened the Pharaoh's heart, 
  and he would not let them go.

  Finally God said to Moses: 
  ``Now you will go free.
  Let each Israelite family ask the Egyptians
  for jewelry of silver and gold: 
  they will give it to you.
  Then let each Israelite family slaughter a lamb, 
  and paint the door-posts of their house with lamb's blood.'' 
  They did. 
  That night, God sent the Angel of Death to Egypt, 
  and the Angel went into each Egyptian house 
  and killed each family's first-born son while he slept. 
  But the Angel passed over the houses that were marked with blood.

  In the night the the Pharaoh awoke
  and saw that his son was dead. 
  He said to Moses and Aaron,
  ``Rise up and go, leave as you have promised,
  and bless me.''
  So the Israelites left in haste,
  carrying Egyptian gold
  and bread that had not yet risen.
  But soon the the Pharaoh changed his mind, 
  and he chased after them with horses and chariots.

  The Israelites came to the shore of the Sea of Reeds, 
  and could not cross. 
  God said to Moses ``Lift up your staff,
  and stretch your hand out over the sea.'' 
  Moses lifted up his staff, 
  and stretched out his hand,
  and the sea parted. 
  The Israelites crossed on dry land. 
  They ran, chased by Egyptian chariots.
  But when the last of the Israelites stepped onto the far shore, 
  the sea closed again.
  The Egyptians drowned, 
  and we were free.

  It is said that Rabbi Levi Yitz\d{h}ak of Berditchev discovered that the young
  girls who kneaded the dough for matzah worked from early in the morning until
  late at night. Every 17 minutes, the workers had to scrub their hands, to be
  sure that no particle of yeast remained on their fingers that might leaven the
  next batch of dough; by the end of a shift, their hands were chapped and
  bloody.  The Rabbi pronounced the matzah treyf because it was produced through
  oshek (the oppression of workers), and said: ``They accuse us of making our
  matzah with the blood of Christians, but in truth we make it from the blood of
  our own people.'' \SSrc

\begin{HgEnglish}
  It is a mitzvah that the Passover matzot be made specifically for the purpose
  of fulfilling the obligation to eat matzot on Passover, as the verse (Exodus,
  12:17) states: You shall guard the matzot. The matzah must be guarded to
  ensure that it does not become chametz; matzah which was not guarded may not
  be used on Passover.

  How do we ``guard'' the matzah used on Passover? 

  From the time that the wheat is taken to the mill to be ground into flour, it
  is kept under careful supervision to make sure that it does not come into
  contact with water or other moisture. We check it to ensure that the wheat is
  clean and whole.  

  The grinding, packing, and transporting of the wheat from the mill to the
  bakery is done under close supervision, to ensure that the ground wheat does
  not come into contact with water, and all of the utensils used for processing
  the wheat must be clean and dry.  

  The wheat is not baked on the same day on which it was ground, for it is still
  warm from the processing and would therefore ferment and become chametz more
  rapidly. It is watched while it is being kneaded to ensure that this is not
  done near an oven or open window which is exposed to the sun, lest the dough
  become hot and ferment quickly.

\begin{HgEnglish}
  It is a Torah mitzvah to eat matzah on Seder night.  Jewish law defines an act
  of ``eating'' as swallowing a kezayit within two to four minutes (kiday
  achilat pras). If this is difficult, you may sip some water while eating. At
  the very least, the matzah must be consumed within nine minutes.  The time
  begins not with the first bite, but with the first swallow.  Therefore, you
  can gain some extra time by chewing up some matzah before taking the first
  swallow.  A kezayit is approximately 45-50 cc, which is roughly two thirds of
  a square matzah, or one half of the hand-made round matzah.

Using mortar and bricks, the Jewish slaves, who were foreigners, the children of
\linebreak
refugees from famine in Canaan, built the pyramids. The charoset reminds us of
the mortar, a symbol of unrewarded toil. Tonight we eat charoset to remember all
exploitation of immigrant labor. Just as many Jews in this country once worked
in sweatshops, immigrants continue to work long hours for poverty wages. We
remember how our ancestors' work enriched the lives of the Egyptians, and
challenge ourselves to think about the ways that many of us currently benefit
from exploited labor. Immigrants plant, pick, and process our food; sew our
clothes; take care of our children; and clean our homes and offices. For Jews,
the descendants of slave laborers who built the pyramids, such profit should
never be sweet. Instead, we take the sweetness of charoset as a symbol of
resistance and the possibility of liberation for all.

  people. In memory not only of the Temple built by the Jews in Jerusalem that
  was destroyed first by the Babylonians and then by the Romans, but also in
  memory of all cultural artifacts destroyed cruelly in wars, we do as Rabbi

  We must understand these two forces, that of servitude and that of freedom,
  not as separate forces which operate independently, each with its own role,
  but as two joined, complementary forces\ldots

  The overall goal will be realized only with the knowledge and recognition that
  these two forces are not contradictory, but are joined in creating the world’s
  ultimate Freedom, the honor and the powerful desirability of which is not
  revealed unless it is crowned by exalted Servitude, servitude before the King
  of Glory, which is also the ultimate freedom.

  Therefore, the perfect form of Freedom comes when it is bound together with
  Servitude, such that a person will find within himself the total control which
  is suitable for a truly free person, who reigns as well upon the greatest of
  forces, which is the force of freedom itself.

\begin{HgEnglish}
In most families, it is customary to hide the matzah during {\bfseries
ya\d{h}atz}. At this point in the evening the children search for the matzah,
and a prize is awarded to the one who finds it.

Traditionally, it's even less straightforward. The seder cannot proceed until
the afikoman has been eaten, and so the child who holds it finds herself with an
excelleng bargaining token. Rather than simply being given a prize, she uses the
matzah to extort a gift of her choosing from the adults.

  As mentioned before, the structure of the Passover seder appears to be

\begin{HgEnglish}
``If some of them fell asleep, they may eat [the afikoman when they awake]; if
all of them fell asleep, they must not eat.''

In the latter case they have a ceased to think about the Paschal lamb; when they
awake it is as though they would eat in two different places, sleep breaking the
continuity of action and place, and thus it is forbidden.

\HgFill

\begin{HgEnglish}
The Afikomen is hidden away during Yachatz (division ceremony) at the beginning
of the Seder. Many families have the custom to allow the children to steal the
Afikomen. If we are trying to teach our children about Torah, how can we teach
them to steal?! The Afikomen represents the future redemption which is hidden
from us. Matzah, which must be eaten only after eating an appetizer to make us
hungry, represents a passion for truth. Eliyahu HaNavi, whom we symbolically
welcome with a fifth cup of wine on Seder-night, ``will return the heart of the
parents to the children and the children to the parents.'' The ``gap'' that
prevents one generation from relating to a previous one is our biggest problem.
When a generation takes the potential they have been given, and misappropriates
it by not applying it to Torah which is the one thing that can help us bridge
the gap between all past generations, they are stealing our future hope. We want
our children to steal the Afikomen instead; they should crave the ``quest'' for
Torah, represented by the matzah of the Afikomen, so that our final hidden
redemption can be revealed.

  It was at Passover time in 1943 that the Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place. On
  that day, April 19th, began the revolt against the Nazis who had come into the
  Ghetto of Warsaw to complete the deportation of the remaining Jews. 40,000
  civilians were led by the Jewish Fighting Organization, several hundred young
  women and men armed with ancient guns and home-made Molotov cocktails.
  Confined in a small area of the Ghetto, they were unable to maneuver beyond a
  few city blocks. The leadership perished in the bunker at 18 Mila Street on
  May 8th; no one surrendered. For weeks thereafter, small groups of resistance
  fighters emerged to battle the Nazis from behind rubble and wreckage.
  Resistance continued until the Nazis burned the entire Ghetto to the ground in

   In the diaspora, this craving for revenge was both understandable and
   ineffective. But the founding of the state of Israel has changed the
   situation completely. In Israel, Jews are far from being defenseless. We
   don’t have to rely on God to take revenge for the evils done unto us, past or
   present, real or imagined. We can pour out our wrath ourselves, on our
   neighbours, the Palestinians and other Arabs, on our minorities, on our
   victims.

   That is the real danger of the Haggadah, as I see it. It was written by and
   for helpless Jews living in perpetual danger. It raised their spirits once a
   year, when they felt safe for a moment, protected by their God, surrounded by
   their families

   %Taken out of this context and applied to a new, completely different
   %situation, it can set us on an evil course. Telling ourselves that everybody
   %is out to destroy us, yesterday and most certainly tomorrow, we consider the
   %grandiloquent bombast of an Iranian bigmouth as a living proof of the
   %validity of the old maxim. They are out to kill us, so we must – according to
   %another ancient Jewish injunction – kill them first.

  Belted at the top of my lungs \\
  In a shower of troubles, good  \\
  Even if off key. Surrounded by death \\
  Loving liars, by fires banked inside \\
  My nature, I stumbled over simple things: \\
  A shoe untied, the pillow never smooth, \\
  A night cough, hum of strangers' tires.

  The gift has been given. So, low but alive, \\
  I said what I believed: that greed succeeds \\
  Where grace can not, that one idea can kill \\
  A world of simple pleasures, cup and spoon. \\
  Stir them. Don't speak quickly, savor \\
  The hot cider, candied ginger on the tongue,  \\
  Heavy cloud shrugged off my shoulders. \\
  I promise to be more than one of those \\
  (What, still alive? He lived? He died?) who never \\
  Show their heart or read the lips of mumblers \\
  In the public record: I call upon the Lord, \\
  Am called upon, to praise in easy words: \\
  A truth should come out plain and make good sense, \\
  So truth will find a friendly audience.

\chapter*{A brief history of this haggadah}

During my undergraduate years, the annual cobbling-together of a haggadah from
assorted prayer books, Maxwell House freebies and miscellaneous online snippets
grew into a March ritual of its own. The haggadah, once constructed and
wine-baptized, was invariably lost---and, in an echo of the pagan springtime
ceremony from which Passover likely derives, refashioned anew each year.  This
document is an attempt to stabilize the process.

Every haggadah is a palimpsest, but this one more than most. Its immediate
progenitor, which I refer to here as the ``Commune Haggadah'', was used in 2011
and 2012 (and possibly earlier) by an eponymous collective of Columbia students
who identified---some ironically and some with deadly seriousness---with various
worldwide socialist movements. The Commune Haggadah appears to have itself been
substantially plagiarized from an earlier ``Socialist Haggadah'' (with the full
cooperation of the latter's author), about which I have been able to determine
only that it was prepared by a friend-of-a-friend, one Eve Goodman, from an
intimidating list of scholarly sources between the years 2003 and 2010.

This is not a Marxist holiday, nor a Marxist haggadah. Nevertheless the basic
story of Passover is the liberation of the oppressed by overwhelming
historical forces, and the basic impulse of the Commune Haggadah was good. It,
and its predecessors, still constitute the spiritual (if no longer the textual)
core of the present document. I can only hope that, transplanted with its
keeper, the Haggadah you now hold will flourish as we have in Cambridge's
strange soil.
